# How YesChat.ai Went from Zero to 5M Monthly Visitors with Extreme SEO

I've been analyzing successful AI companies lately, trying to understand what separates the winners from the countless failed attempts. Today I want to share one of the most impressive growth stories I've come across - and honestly, their SEO strategy completely blew my mind.

I spend a few hours each week digging into these companies, and my analysis isn't perfect. But when I see something this remarkable, I have to share it with fellow builders.

## The YesChat.ai Story

Let me start with yeschat.ai - and trust me, by the end of this post, you'll understand why I'm so fascinated by their approach.

Here's what caught my attention:

This company launched in November 2023 as a simple Claude 2 wrapper. No phone verification, completely free - basically what most of us ship as our MVP, right? Nothing fancy, just another AI chat interface.

Fast forward to today, and they've built something massive. We're talking AI chat across all major models, AI music, images, video generation, over 200,000 GPTs, and even their own AI directory. Their traffic? 5 million monthly visitors according to SimilarWeb (and we all know those numbers are usually conservative).

But here's the kicker - over 70% of their traffic is organic search. They're not buying ads. They're not doing massive PR campaigns. They've cracked the SEO code in a way that most of us can only dream of.

## The SEO Masterclass

### Landing Page Optimization

Their homepage teaches us several lessons. Below the hero section, they've got a product demo video that immediately shows you how everything works. This isn't just good UX - it's smart SEO. Users understand the product instantly without reading walls of text, which probably improves their bounce rate and time on site.

Further down, you'll find all the classic landing page elements: what is sections, how-to guides, FAQs, testimonials. These aren't really for users - they're feeding the search engines exactly what they need to understand and rank the site.

But the footer is where things get interesting:

Look at that footer - it's absolutely packed. From a design perspective, it's almost ugly. But from an SEO perspective? It's genius. They're using their homepage's authority to boost internal pages by keeping link depth shallow. Every URL in that footer gets more crawler attention and link equity.

Most users never scroll to the footer anyway, so they're not really hurting UX. But they're maximizing their SEO real estate.

### Tool Pages That Actually Rank

Here's where they get really smart:

1. **No login walls** - Every tool page is accessible to crawlers and users alike. When someone searches for a specific AI tool, they can land directly on the relevant page.

2. **Individual page optimization** - Each tool has its own "How It Works" section, tips, and explanatory content. This helps search engines understand exactly what each page offers.

3. **Seamless UX** - Everything happens on one page. You use the tool and see results without any redirects or additional steps.

### The GPT Store Gold Rush

Here's where their strategy gets really interesting. Let me take you back to January 10, 2024 - the day OpenAI launched the GPT Store. Within hours, users had created over 3 million custom GPTs.

But here's the problem: these GPTs had minimal descriptions and zero SEO optimization. You literally couldn't find them through Google search.

YesChat saw the opportunity and moved fast. Within weeks, they had migrated thousands of popular GPTs to their platform - but with a crucial difference. They wrapped each one with proper SEO: detailed descriptions, how-to guides, FAQs, the works.

The result? They started ranking for thousands of long-tail keywords. Even today, their top traffic drivers include terms like "astrologer bot" and "homeworkify" - all from GPT-related searches.

Here's the brilliant part: they couldn't predict which GPTs would blow up. So they cast a wide net, optimizing for anything with decent traction. Tech adoption takes time - while we in the industry moved on from GPT novelty, regular users were just discovering these tools and Googling them.

**Takeaway for builders**: The GPT Store is still underexploited. There are trending bots worth pulling out and turning into standalone, SEO-optimized products.

### Multi-Language Done Right

Most companies mess up internationalization. They translate pages and expect traffic to magically appear. But YesChat did something smarter.

When they migrated GPTs, they included ones that were already popular in other languages. Since they had the original descriptions as reference material, they could create quality localized content that actually matched search intent in those markets.

This isn't just machine translation - it's strategic content localization based on existing demand.

### Revenue Model

Since all the GPTs are free (they're traffic magnets), how do they make money?

Three main revenue streams:

1. **Premium subscriptions** - Their core AI chat/music/image/video products
2. **Advertising** - Monetizing the free GPT pages with ads to offset API costs
3. **Directory submissions** - Their AI directory site accepts paid listings

If they can cover API costs with ads alone, this becomes an incredibly scalable business model.

## What We Can Learn

This case study shows us that extreme SEO isn't just about technical optimization - it's about identifying content gaps in the market and filling them aggressively.

YesChat found a massive opportunity (unsearchable GPTs), moved quickly to capture it, and built sustainable traffic that compounds over time. That's the kind of strategic thinking that separates successful companies from the rest of us.

The GPT Store opportunity is still there. The question is: who's going to be next to exploit it?
