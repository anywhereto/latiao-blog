The psychology behind SaaS pricing that most founders completely miss
Been working with SaaS startups as a developer for years now, and holy shit the amount of founders who mess up their pricing is insane. They spend months perfecting features but like 20 minutes deciding how to price them.

Here's some pricing psychology stuff that actually works but most founders completely ignore:

The anchoring effect is real af When you show your expensive plan first, it makes everything else seem like a bargain. Had a client who was struggling with conversions until we reordered their pricing page to show the premium plan first. Suddenly their middle tier started selling like crazy. People saw the $199/mo plan and thought "well $79 is a steal compared to that!"

Freemium is usualy a trap One client had 10,000+ free users but only like 12 paying customers. Their free plan was way too generous. Another client ditched freemium entirely, switched to a 14-day trial and hit $25K MRR in under 6 months. The differnce? People actually had to make a decision instead of sitting in free-user purgatory forever.

The $9.99 thing actually works Yeah it seems stupid and everyone knows what your doing, but it still affects purchase decisions. Harvard Business School found that a 1% improvement in pricing can lead to an 11% increase in profit. We've tested this with multiple clients and charm pricing consistently outperforms round numbers.

Simpler is always better If your pricing page needs an FAQ section to explain it, you've already lost. Most users won't email to ask questions about your pricing - they'll just bounce. Keep it stupid simple: 2-3 plans max, clear names, bullet points.

Enterprise "contact us" pricing creates FOMO This is mind blowing but we saw it with 3 different clients - when you hide your top-tier pricing behind a "contact us" button, it creates weird FOMO for big customers. They imagine they're missing out on some special features. Enterprise leads literally tripled for one client after making this change.

Higher prices can increase demand (seriously) Zendesk actually RAISED prices for enterprise plans when they weren't selling, and suddenly demand went up. Enterprise buyers saw the lower price as a red flag - "if it's cheap, it must not be good enough for us." Same product, higher price, more sales. Wild.

I see so many founders pricing based on competitors or their costs instead of psychology. The data is clear tho - understanding how people perceive pricing matters way more than your actual costs.
